/// change and cached; a frame's whole job is restyling at most
/// [RevealEngine.fadeWindow] characters in the one segment the reveal head is
/// inside. Every segment behind it is already settled and returns its cached
/// widget untouched.

/// Segments beyond the head are not built at all, so the document ends where
/// the animation is and nothing appears below the reading position before it
